            Ryan Arnold is a former Networking and Computer Forensics student who discovered a passion for coding. He is proficient in HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. He got the idea for this project from having countless arguments and debates with friends at the D&D table about the effects of specific spells. GIven that most of his games were hosted online, it was difficult for him to show the source books to his fellow players or DM. So, he set to work on a site that could allow he and his friends to quickly and easily lookup the information they sought. Thus, 5e Spell Lookup was born!
